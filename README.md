Dynamic Landing Page Builder
This is a full-stack project built with Next.js and Contentful that enables non-technical users to build and edit dynamic landing pages using a custom drag-and-drop interface.

The project consists of two parts:

A custom Contentful App that acts as a page builder.

A Next.js frontend that fetches and renders the page layout and content.

üöÄ Technical Stack
Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, React, Native CSS Modules

Headless CMS: Contentful

API: Contentful GraphQL API

Deployment: Vercel

3. Set up Contentful:

Create a new Contentful Space.

Import the content model: Use the contentful-cli to import the content model from a JSON file, or manually recreate the content types as described in the "Contentful Model Notes" section below.
